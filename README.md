# Machine Learning From Scratch In C++ Using Statistics, Linear Algebra


To understand utilities such as Tensorflow, Scikit and the like, I wanted to build some algorithms in a lower level language such as C to gain greater familiarity with machine learning. This project implements both linear and logistic regression to test datasets of wine to see if it can predict the quality of wine. It then compares the results with python. We achieved near identical results to python libraries, a major success given that C is a more efficient language.
